# What the heck, HTML and CSS?

**What the heck, HTML and CSS?** is a list of reasons your HTML and/or CSS is broken. Put another way, it's a list of common HTML and CSS quandaries, miscues, and dilemmas created with the goal of making them *less* common.

This is a fork of [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)'s site [WTF, HTML and CSS?](http://wtfhtmlcss.com/) and just removes the PG-13 words.
